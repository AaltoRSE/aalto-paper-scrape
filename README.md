# Scrape Aalto papers

Not yet documented publicy, see our issue tracker for the base URL.

* `--help` gives arguments

* The design is to be idemponent.  If you re-run with the same output,
  it will only do work (downloading and combining) that hasn't already
  been done.  It won't update existing papers.

* Base URL for starting the scrape isn't yet public.
